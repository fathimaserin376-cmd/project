##BLOGSITE WITH COMMENT SECTION
The Blog Site with Comment Section is a simple web application that allows users to read blog posts and share their thoughts by adding comments. It provides an interactive platform for readers to engage with blog content, enhancing communication between the author and the audience.
##How It Works

Homepage Display:
The website lists all blog posts with titles and short descriptions.

Read Post:
When a user selects a post, it opens a detailed view showing the full content.

Add Comment:
Below each post, users can enter their name and comment in a form.

Comment Display:
Once submitted, the comment appears instantly under the post.

In the frontend-only version, comments are stored in the browser using localStorage.

In the full-stack (PHP/MySQL) version, comments are saved permanently in the database.

Persistence:
Users can revisit the page and still see their comments, depending on the storage method used.
